This program similize the job of critical section for process. Assuming a process can only stay in the critical section for five units of time (bounding time) and have to 
leave and stay at the situation of Remainder, waiting for next turn to be in the critical section. At the same, time the next process can enter the critical section.
This program is based on the idea from Decker's algorithm.
